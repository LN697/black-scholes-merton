# Rich terminal interface with real-time monitoring
bsm --mode interactive --market-data bloomberg://equity/options
bsm price --underlying AAPL --strike 150 --expiry 30d --volatility-model lstm
bsm calibrate --model heston-slv --target-quotes market.csv --parallel 8
```

#### Web Dashboard
- React-based professional trading interface

#### Python Integration
```python
import bsm_toolkit as bsm

# Seamless Python-C++ interoperability
pricer = bsm.AnalyticalPricer()
result = pricer.price_european(S=100, K=105, T=0.25, r=0.05, sigma=0.2)
print(f"Price: {result.price:.4f}, Delta: {result.delta:.4f}")

# ML-enhanced pricing
ml_pricer = bsm.MLEnhancedPricer(model_type="lstm")
ml_result = ml_pricer.price_with_uncertainty(option_params, market_data)
```
